# Insights into LendingClub.com Client Loan Portfolio
Key words: Lending, Borrowing, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Statistics, Clustering

The project analyses the data provided by LendingClub.com, a financial services company that gives the opportunity to investors to choose potential borrowers. 
It is divided into two parts:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: this involves clustering clients based on their characteristics when they first approach the company. The goal is to identify specific groups of clients who are more likely to receive a loan.
- **Supervised Learning**: this part aims to understand the variables that have the greatest influence on the investors and on the company's decision-making process regarding the client, such as the interest rate on the loan and whether the client complies with the company's credit policy. Subsequently, predictive models are created to forecast the company's decisions, with the best model(s) being evaluated for effectiveness. The data was processed using R programming language within the Rsudio environment. Version control was conducted through GitHub
